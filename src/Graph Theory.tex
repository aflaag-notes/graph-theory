    \chapter{Basics of Graph Theory}

    In the 18th century, in the city of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg}{Königsberg} (Prussia), a puzzle captured the imagination of the townspeople. Königsberg, nestled along the winding \tit{Pregel River}, was divided into four land masses --- two parts of the mainland and two islands, Kneiphof and Lomse. Connecting these regions were \tbf{seven bridges}, crisscrossing the river back and forth.

    Over time, a curious question arose among the people of Königsberg: was it possible to take a \tit{walk} through the city, crossing each of the seven bridges \tbf{exactly once}, without retracing any steps, and ending the walk in the same place where it started? This is known as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg}{Seven Bridges of Königsberg} problem.

        It seemed simple enough, yet no one had managed to do it. The challenge became a favorite pastime, debated in marketplaces and whispered about in taverns. Some claimed it was possible with the right path, while others remained skeptical.

    \centeredimage[The map of Königsberg in Euler's time, showing the actual layout of the seven bridges. \cite{bridges}]{0.5}{../assets/konigsberg.png}

    Word of this peculiar problem reached the brilliant Swiss mathematician, \href{/}{Leonhard Euler}, a man whose mind was always drawn to patterns and logic. Intrigued, Euler set out to solve the riddle --- not by drawing endless maps or walking the streets himself, but by \tbf{abstracting} the problem into something entirely new.

    Euler realized that the specific layout of the city was \tit{irrelevant}. What truly mattered was the way the landmasses were connected by the bridges. He represented each landmass as a \tbf{dot} and each bridge as a \tbf{line} between them. In doing so, he stripped away unnecessary details and created a simple, elegant combinatorial structure that we know refer to as \tbf{graph}.

    \begin{figure}[H]

        \begin{tikzpicture}[-,>=stealth,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=3cm,thick,main node/.style={scale=0.6,circle,draw,font=\sffamily\normalsize}]
            \node[main node] (1) {};
            \node[main node] (2) [below left of=1, xshift = -50] {};
            \node[main node] (3) [below right of=2, xshift = 50] {};
            \node[main node] (4) [right of=2, xshift = 75] {};

                (1) edge (4)
                (3) edge (4)
                ;
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{The graph drawn by Euler which models the \tit{Seven Bridges of Königsberg} problem.}
        \label{konigsberg}
    \end{figure}

    Through his analysis, Euler discovered a fundamental rule: for a walk to cross each bridge exactly once and return to the starting point, every landmass had to be connected by an \tbf{even} number of bridges. In Königsberg's case, however, each landmass had an odd number of bridges, making the task impossible.

    Euler's proof, published in 1736, was groundbreaking --- not just because he solved the Königsberg puzzle, but because he laid the foundation for an entirely new branch of mathematics: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory}{graph theory}. His ideas would go on to shape the study of networks, from modern transportation systems to social media connections and even the vast web of the internet itself. And so, from a simple question about bridges in a small Prussian city, a whole new field of mathematics was born—one that continues to shape the world centuries later.

    This chapter will discuss the basics of the field of \tbf{graph theory}, and will lay the foundation for later chapters.

    \section{Introduction}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Graph}
        A \tbf{graph} is a pair $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the --- finite --- set of \tbf{vertices} of the graph, and $E$ is the set of \tbf{edges}.
    \end{frameddefn}

    For now, will assume to be working with \tbf{simple} and \tbf{undirected} graphs, i.e. graphs in which the set of edges is defined as follows $$E \subseteq [V]^2 = \{\{x, y\} \mid x, y \in V \land x \neq v\}$$ where the notation $\{x, y\}$ will be used to indicate an edge between two nodes $x, y \in V$, and will be replaced with $xy = yx$ directly --- the \tit{set} notation for edges is used to highlight that edges have no direction.

    We will indicate with $n$ and $m$ the cardinality of $\abs V$ and $\abs E$, respectively. Moreover, we will indicate with $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ the set of the vertices and edges of $G$ respectively when there is ambiguity.

        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{A simple graph.}
        \label{first graph}
    \end{figure}

    Note that, in this definition, we are assuming that each edge has exactly 2 \tit{distinct} endpoints --- i.e. the graphs do not admit \tbf{loops} --- and there cannot exist two edges with the same endpoints. In fact, if we drop these assumption we obtain what is called a \tbf{multigraph}.

    \end{figure}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Subgraph}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a \tbf{subgraph} $G' = (V', E')$ of $G$ is a graph  such that $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.
    \end{frameddefn}

        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{This is a subgraph of the graph shown in \cref{first graph}.}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Induced subgraph}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a subgraph $G' = (V', E')$ of $G$ is \tbf{induced} if every edge of $G$ with both ends in $V$ is an edge of $V'$.
    \end{frameddefn}

    This definition is \tit{stricter} than the previous one: in fact, the last graph is \tit{not} an example of an induced subgraph, but the following is:

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}[-,>=stealth,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=1.75cm, thick,main node/.style={scale=0.9,circle,draw,font=\sffamily\normalsize}]

            \node[circle, draw] (3) [below of = 1]{};
            % \node[circle, draw] (4) [below of = 2]{};
            \node[circle, draw] (5) [left of = 1]{};

            % \draw[-] (1) to (2);
            \draw[-] (1) to (3);
            % \draw[-] (2) to (4);
            \draw[-] (1) to (5);
            % \draw[-] (3) to (4);
            \draw[-] (3) to (5);

            ;
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{This is an \tit{induced} subgraph of the graph shown in \cref{first graph}.}
        \label{induced subgraph first graph}
    \end{figure}

    Note that every induced subgraph of a graph is \tbf{unique} by definition, and we indicate each induced subgraph as follows: suppose that the graph in \cref{first graph} had the following \tit{labeling} on the vertices

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}[-,>=stealth,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=1.75cm, thick,main node/.style={scale=0.9,circle,draw,font=\sffamily\normalsize}]

            \node[circle, draw] (1) []{1};
            \node[circle, draw] (2) [right of = 1]{2};
            \node[circle, draw] (3) [below of = 1]{3};
            \node[circle, draw] (4) [below of = 2]{4};
            \node[circle, draw] (5) [left of = 1]{5};

            \draw[-] (1) to (2);
            \draw[-] (1) to (3);
            \draw[-] (2) to (4);
            \draw[-] (1) to (5);
            \draw[-] (3) to (4);
            \draw[-] (3) to (5);

            ;
        \end{tikzpicture}
        % \caption{This is an \tit{induced} subgraph of the graph shown in \cref{first graph}.}
    \end{figure}

    then, the induced subgraph in \cref{induced subgraph first graph} would have been referred to as $G[\{1, 3, 5\}]$.

    Intuitively, two vertices $x, y \in V$ are said to be \tbf{adjacent}, if there is an edge $xy \in E$, and we write $x \sim y$. If there is no such edge, we write $x \nsim y$ for non-adjacency. The \tbf{neighborhood} of a vertex $x \in V$ is the set of vertices that are adjacent to $x$, and it will be indicated as follows $$\mathcal N (x) := \{y \in V \mid x \sim y\}$$ The \tbf{degree} of a vertex $x \in V$, denoted with $\deg(x)$, is exactly $\abs{\mathcal N (x)}$. We will use the following notation for the \tbf{minimum} and \tbf{maximum} degree of a graph, respectively

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ccc}
            $\displaystyle \delta := \min_{x \in V}{\deg(x)}$ & \qquad & $\displaystyle \Delta := \max_{x \in V}{\deg(x)}$
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \begin{framedlem}{Handshaking lemma}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, it holds that $$\sum_{x \in V}{\deg(x)} = 2 \abs E$$
    \end{framedlem}

    \begin{proof}
        Trivially, the sum of the degrees counts every edge in $E$ exactly twice, once for each of the 2 endpoints.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{frameddefn}{$k$-regular graph}
        A graph $G$ is said to be \tbf{$k$-regular} if every vertex of $G$ has degree $k$.
    \end{frameddefn}

    Note that in a $k$-regular graph it holds that $$\sum_{x \in V}{\deg(x)} = k \cdot n$$

    \begin{framedprop}{}
        There are no $k$-regular graphs with $k$ odd and an odd number of vertices.
    \end{framedprop}
    
    \begin{proof}
        By way of contradiction, suppose that there exists a $k$-regular graph $G = (V, E)$ such that both $k$ and $n$ are odd; however, by the handshaking lemma we would get that $$2 \abs E = \sum_{x \in V} {\deg(x)} = k \cdot n$$ but the product of two odd numbers, namely $k$ and $n$, is still an odd number, while $2 \abs E$ must be even $\lightning$.
    \end{proof}

    \subsection{Important structures}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Path}
        A \tbf{path} is a \tit{graph} with vertex set $x_0, \ldots, x_n$ and edge set $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ such that $e_i = x_{i - 1}x_i$.

        The \tbf{length} of a path is the number of edges between $x_0$ and $x_n$, i.e. $\abs{\{e_1, \ldots, e_n\}}$, namely $n$ in this case. A path of length 1 is called \tit{trivial} path.
    \end{frameddefn}

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}[-,>=stealth,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=1.75cm, thick,main node/.style={scale=0.9,circle,draw,font=\sffamily\normalsize}]

            \node[circle, draw] (1) []{$x_0$};
            \node[circle, draw] (2) [right of = 1]{$x_1$};
            \node[circle, draw] (3) [right of = 2]{$x_2$};
            \node[circle, draw] (4) [right of = 3]{$x_3$};
            \node[circle, draw] (5) [right of = 4]{$x_4$};

            \draw[-] (1) to node[above]{$e_1$} (2);
            \draw[-] (2) to node[above]{$e_2$} (3);
            \draw[-] (3) to node[above]{$e_3$} (4);
            \draw[-] (4) to node[above]{$e_4$} (5);

            ;
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{A path graph of length 4 that links $x_0$ and $x_4$.}
    \end{figure}

    Through \tit{paths} we can provide the definition of \tbf{distance} between two nodes of a graph.

    \begin{frameddefn}{Distance}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, and two vertices $x, y \in V$, the \tbf{distance} between $x$ and $y$ in $G$, denoted with $\dist_G(x, y)$, is defined as the length of the \tit{shortest} path between $x$ and $y$ in $G$.
    \end{frameddefn}

    If there is no ambiguity, we will simply write $\dist(x, y)$ instead of $\dist_G(x, y)$. Finally, given a path $P$ and two vertices $u, v \in V(P)$, we will denote with $u \ P \ v$ the \tit{subpath} of $P$ between $u$ and $v$. Now, consider the following definition.

    \begin{frameddefn}{Walk}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a \tbf{walk} is a \tit{sequence} of vertices and edges $$x_0 \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ x_k$$ where $x_0, \ldots, x_k \in V$, $e_1, \ldots, e_k \in E$ and $e_i = x_{i - 1}x_i$.

        The \tbf{length} of a walk is the number of edges between $x_0$ and $x_k$, i.e. $\abs{\{e_1, \ldots , e_k \}}$, namely $k$ in this case. If $x_0 = x_k$ we say that the walk is \tbf{closed}.
    \end{frameddefn}

    If there is a path -- or a walk --- between two vertices $x, y \in V$, we say that the path --- or the walk --- \tbf{links} $x$ and $y$, and we write this as $x \to y$. Any vertex that is different from $x$ and $y$ is called \tit{internal node}. For instance, given the previous graph labeled as follows

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}[-,>=stealth,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=1.75cm, thick,main node/.style={scale=0.9,circle,draw,font=\sffamily\normalsize}]

            \node[circle, draw] (1) []{1};
            \node[circle, draw] (2) [right of = 1]{2};
            \node[circle, draw] (3) [below of = 1]{3};
            \node[circle, draw] (4) [below of = 2]{4};
            \node[circle, draw] (5) [left of = 1]{5};

            \draw[-] (1) to (2);
            \draw[-] (1) to (3);
            \draw[-] (2) to (4);
            \draw[-] (1) to (5);
            \draw[-] (3) to (4);
            \draw[-] (3) to (5);

            ;
        \end{tikzpicture}
        % \caption{Giv}
    \end{figure}

    an example of a walk over this graph is given by the following sequence $$1 \ \{1, 2\} \ 2 \ \{2, 4\} \ 4 \ \{4, 3\} \ 3 \ \{3, 1\} \ 1 \ \{1, 5\} \ 5$$ that \tit{links} 1 and 5, i.e. the walk is of the form $1 \to 5$.

    Note that there is a subtle difference between the definitions of \tbf{path} and \tbf{walk}: the definition of a path implies that this is always a \tit{graph} on its own, while a walk is defined as a \tit{sequence}. Nonetheless, we will treat \tit{paths} as if they where \tit{sequences} as well. This assumption holds for the following structures that will be discussed as well.

    However, by definition of path, not every alternating sequence of vertices and edges is a valid path, in fact:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item in a \tit{walk} it is possible to repeat both vertices and edges
        \item in a \tit{path} there can be no repetition of vertices nor edges (note that \tit{edge} repetition implies \tit{vertex} repetition)
    \end{itemize}

    For instance, the previous example of \tit{walk} is not a valid \tit{path}, because the vertex 1 is repeated.

    \begin{framedthm}[label={paths and walks}]{Paths and walks}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ and two vertices $x, y \in V$, in $G$ there is a path $x \to y$ if and only if there is a walk $x \to y$.
    \end{framedthm}

    \begin{proof}
        By definition, every path is a walk, thus the direct implication is trivially true. To prove the converse implication, consider two vertices $x$ and $y$ for which there is at least one walk $x \to y$ in $G$. Now, out of all the possible walks $x \to y$ in $G$, consider the \tit{shortest} one, i.e. the one with the least amount of edges, and let it be the following sequence $$x \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ y $$ By way of contradiction, assume that this walk is not a path. Therefore, there must be either one vertex or one edge repeated, but since edge repetition always implies vertex repetition, we just need to take this case into account. Assume that there are two indices $i, j \in [k - 1]$ such that $i \neq j$ and $x_i = x_j$; however this implies that $$x \ e_1 \ \ldots \ x_{i - 1} \ e_i \ x_i \ e_{j + 1} \ x_{j + 1} \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ y$$ is still a walk $x \to y$ of strictly shorter length, but we chose the original sequence to be the \tit{shortest} possible walk $x \to y$ $\lightning$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{framedprop}[label={longest path len}]{}
        The longest path in any graph has a length of at least $\delta$.
    \end{framedprop}
    
    \begin{proof}
        Consider a graph $G = (V, E)$, and let $P$ be a longest path in $G$, labeled as follows $$x_0 \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ x_k$$ and assume that its length is $k$. Since $P$ is a longest path in $G$, $x_k$ cannot have neighbors outside $P$ itself, otherwise $P$ would not have been the longest path of $G$ --- it could have been extended by one of $x_k$'s neighbors. This implies that $$\mathcal N(x_k) \subseteq \{x_0, \ldots, x_{k - 1}\}$$ and since $\delta \le \deg(x_k) := \abs{\mathcal N(x_k)}$ by definition of $\delta$, this implies that $$\delta \le \abs{\{x_0, \ldots, x_{k - 1}\}} = k$$
    \end{proof}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Cycle}
        A \tbf{cycle} is a \tit{graph} with vertex set $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ and edge set $x_1x_2, x_2x_3, \ldots, x_{n- 1}x_n, x_nx_1$.

        The \tbf{length} of a cycle is the number of edges between $x_1$ and $x_n$, namely $n$ in this case. A cycle of length $n$ is denoted as $C_n$.

    A graph that does not admit cycle subgraphs --- or \tit{cycles}, for short --- is said to be \tbf{acyclic}.

    \begin{framedprop}[label={min deg 2}]{}
        Every graph with $\delta \ge 2$ has a cycle of length at least $\delta + 1$.
    \end{framedprop}

    \begin{proof}
        Consider the proof of \cref{longest path len}; by applying the same reasoning, we know that $x_k$ cannot have neighbors outside $P$ itself. However, since $\delta \ge 2$, and $x_k \sim x_{k - 1}$, there must be at least one vertex in $x_k$'s neighborhood that lies in $P$. Therefore, let $x_i$ be the first vertex of $P$ --- w.r.t. our labeling of $P$ --- that is adjacent to $x_k$; hence, we have $$\mathcal N (x_k) \subseteq \{x_i, \ldots, x_{k - 1}\} \implies \delta \le \abs{\{x_i, \ldots, x_{k - 1}\}}$$ which implies that $x_i, \ldots, x_{k - 1}, x_k, x_i$ is a cycle of length at least $\delta + 1$.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Connected graph}
        An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be \tbf{connected} if and only if for each vertex pair $x, y \in V$ there is a path $x \to y$.
    \end{frameddefn}

    All the graphs that we presented so far are \tit{connected}, thus the following figure provides an example of an \tbf{disconnected} graph.

    \end{figure}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Component}
        Given a graph $G$, a \tbf{component} of $G$ is a maximal connected subgraph of $G$.
    \end{frameddefn}

    For instance, the graph of the previous example is made up of 2 components, namely the following two subgraphs $$C_1 = (\{1, 5\}, \{\{1, 5\}\})$$ $$C_2 = (\{2, 3, 4\}, \{\{2, 4\}, \{4, 3\}\})$$

    \begin{framedprop}[label={avoid cycle}]{}
        If $G$ is a connected graph, and $C$ is a cycle in $G$, then for any edge $e \in C$ it holds that $G - \{e\}$ is still connected.
    \end{framedprop}

    \begin{proof}
        Consider a graph $G = (V, E)$ that has a cycle $C$, and any two vertices $x, y \in V$; in particular, since $G$ is connected, there must exist a path $x \to y$ in $G$, and let this path be $$P = x \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ y$$ Consider an edge $e \in C$; if $P$ does not traverse $e$, trivially $G - \{e\}$ will still contain $P$.

        Now let $$C = z_1 \ f_2 \ z_2 \ \ldots \ z_{l- 1} \ f_l \ z_l \ f_{l + 1} \ z_1$$ and w.l.o.g. assume that $e = f_2 = z_1 z_2 = x_i x_{i + 1} = e_{i + 1}$ for some $i \in [k - 1]$. Thus we can construct the following walk $$x \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_i \ f_{l + 1} \ z_l \ \ldots \ f_3 \ z_2 \ e_{i + 2} \ x_{i + 2} \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ y$$ from $x$ to $y$, and by \cref{paths and walks} we have that there is a path from $x \to y$, which proves that $G - \{e\}$ is still connected.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{frameddefn}{Tree}
        A \tbf{tree} is a connected acyclic graph. Usually, but not necessarily, there is a fixed vertex called \tbf{root}, and any vertex that has degree 1 in the tree is called \tbf{leaf}.

The first vertex of $P_y$ that is encountered by tracing $P_x$ from $x$ to $r$ is called \tbf{lowest common ancestor} (LCA) of $x$ and $y$.

    \begin{framedthm}[label={tree alt}]{Alternative definitions of tree}
        Given a graph $T = (V, E)$, the following statements are equivalent:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $T$ is a tree
            \item every vertex pair of $T$ is connected by a unique path
            \item $T$ is \tit{minimally connected}, i.e. $T$ is connected and $\forall e \in E$ it holds that $T- \{e\}$ is disconnected
            \item $T$ is \tit{maximally acyclic}, i.e. $T$ is acyclic and $\forall x, y \in V$ such that $x \nsim y$, it holds that $T \cup \{xy\}$ has a cycle
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{framedthm}

    \begin{proof}
        We will prove the statements cyclically.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $1 \implies 2$. By contrapositive, assume that in $T$ there exist two vertices $x, y \in V$ for which there are two distinct paths $P$ and $Q$ of the form $x \to y$. If $P$ and $Q$ are edge-disjoint, then $P \cup Q$ is a cycle, which implies that $T$ is not a tree by definition.

                Otherwise, assume that $P$ and $Q$ are not edge-disjoint. If we start say in $x$, and we follow $Q$ edge by edge since $P$ and $Q$ are distinct, at some point we will encounter an edge $\{u, v\}$ such that $u \in P \cap Q$ and $v \in Q - P$ --- possibly, $u = x$ itself. Moreover, since both paths lead to $y$, if we keep following $Q$ we will encounter a vertex $z \in P \cap Q$ --- possibly, $z = y$ itself --- from which the two paths will coincide. Let $Q'$ be the subpath of $P$ starting with $u$ and ending in $z$; then, $Q' \cup (Q - P)$ is a cycle in $T$, which implies that $T$ is not a tree by definition.

            \item $2 \implies 3$. Consider an edge $xy \in E$; this edge itself is a path $x \to y$, and if we assume statement 2 this implies that it is the \tit{only} path from $x$ to $y$. This implies that $T - \{xy\}$ cannot contain a path from $x$ to $y$, therefore $T - \{xy\}$ is disconnected.
            \item $3 \implies 4$. Since statement 3 implies that $T$ is connected, by \cref{avoid cycle} we have that $T$ is acyclic. Now, pick $x, y \in V$ such that $x \nsim y$; by connectivity of $T$ there must be a path $x \to y$ in $T$, and let this path be $P$. Lastly, since $x \nsim y$, we have that $P \cup \{xy\}$ is a cycle in $T$.
            \item $4 \implies 1$ By contrapositive, we want to prove that if $T$ is not a tree, then $T$ is not maximally acyclic. Note that if $T$ is not a tree, we have two options:

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item if $T$ is connected but contains a cycle, then $T$ is clearly not maximally acyclic
                    \item if $T$ is acyclic but disconnected, then by definition there must exist two vertices $x, y \in V$ such that there is no path $x \to y$, which implies that $T \cup \{xy\}$ still does not contain any cycle

        Every tree with at least 2 vertices has a leaf.

    \begin{proof}
        By way of contradiction, assume $T$ is a tree with at least 2 vertices that does not contain any leaves; then $\delta \ge 2$ in $T$, which implies that $T$ contains a cycle of length at least $\delta + 1$ by \cref{min deg 2}.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{framedlem}[label={tree without leaf}]{}
        Given a tree $T$, and a leaf $v$ of $T$, it holds that $T - \{v\}$ is still a tree.
    \end{framedlem}

    \begin{proof}
        Since $T$ is acyclic by definition, $T - \{v\}$ is still acyclic, we just need to prove that $T - \{v\}$ is still connected. By way of contradiction, assume that in $T - \{v\}$ there exist two vertices $x$ and $y$ such that there is no path between them. However, since $T$ is connected, there is a path $P$ of the form $x \to y$ in $T$.

        Note that, if by removing $v$ from $T$ we disconnect $x$ and $y$, it must be that $v$ lies in $P$. Moreover, since $v$ is in $T$ but not in $T - \{v\}$, while both $x$ and $y$ are also in $T - \{v\}$, it must be that $v$ is an \tit{internal} node of $P$, i.e. $v \neq x, y$, which implies that $\deg(v) \ge 2$ by definition of path, contradicting the hypothesis for which $v$ was a leaf $\lightning$.

        When $n = 1$, there are no edges in the tree, and $0 = m = 1 - 1$.

        Assume that for a tree that has $n = k - 1$ nodes the statement holds.
    }{
        We will prove the statement for a tree $T$ that has $n = k$ nodes. Note that, since $n = 1$ is the base case, we can assume that $n = k \ge 2$, hence by \cref{leaf existence} $T$ contains at least one leaf. Let this leaf be $v$; then, by \cref{tree without leaf} it holds that $T - \{v\}$ is still a tree, and clearly $T - \{v\}$ has $k - 1$ nodes, which implies that we can apply the inductive hypothesis on $T - \{v\}$, i.e. $$\abs{E(T - \{v\})} = \abs{V(T - \{v\})} - 1 = k - 1 - 1 = k - 2$$ However, note that $v$ is a leaf, concluding that $$m = \abs{E(T)} = \abs{E(T - \{v\})} + 1 = k - 2 + 1 = k - 1 = n - 1$$

    \begin{frameddefn}{Spanning tree}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a \tbf{spanning tree} $T$ of $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ such that

        \begin{itemize}
            \item $T$ is a tree
            \item $V(T) = V(G)$, i.e. $T$ \tit{spans} every vertex of $G$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frameddefn}

    For instance, given the graph in \cref{first graph}, a possible spanning tree is the following:

    \end{figure}

    \begin{framedlem}[label={spanning tree existence}]{}
        Any connected graph has a spanning tree.
    \end{framedlem}

    \begin{proof}
        Consider a connected graph $G$, and keep removing edges from $E(G)$ --- and their relative endpoints from $V(G)$ --- one by one, as long as $G$ is still connected. If no other edge can be removed from $G$ without violating connectivity, we will end up with a graph that must be a tree by statement 3 of \cref{tree alt}.
    \end{proof}

    Thanks to this last proposition, we can actually prove a stronger version of the \cref{m n - 1}, which is the following.

    \begin{framedthm}{}
        $T$ is a tree if and only if $T$ is connected and $m = n - 1$.
    \end{framedthm}

    \begin{proof}
        The direct implication is proved in \cref{m n - 1}, so we just need to prove the converse implication. Consider a connected graph $T$ such that $m = n - 1$; by \cref{spanning tree existence} $T$ must have a spanning tree $T'$, and by \cref{m n - 1} itself it holds that $\abs{E(T')} = \abs{V(T')} - 1$. However, $T'$ is a spanning tree of $T$, therefore $$V(T) = V(T') \implies \abs{V(T)} = \abs{V(T')} \implies \abs{E(T')} = \abs{V(T)} - 1 = \abs{E(T)}$$ which implies $E(T) = E(T')$ because $T'$ is a subgraph of $T$, therefore $T = T'$, concluding that $T$ must be a tree since $T'$ is a tree.

    \begin{frameddefn}{Bipartite graph}
        A graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be \tbf{bipartite} if there exists a set $X \subseteq V$ such that every edge of $G$ has exactly one endpoint in $X$ and one in $V - X$. If such a set $X$ exists, we say that $(X, V - x)$ is a \tbf{bipartition} of $G$.

    There are various types of graphs that can be bipartitioned. For example, any \tbf{tree} $T$ can be bipartitioned through a bipartition $(X, V(T) - X)$ by considering the following set of vertices $$X := \{v \in V(T) \mid \dist(r, v) \ \mathrm{even}\}$$ where $r$ is $T$'s root.

    However, \tit{not every type} of graph can be bipartitioned. For instance, consider the following type.

    \begin{frameddefn}{Clique}
        A \tbf{clique} is a \tit{graph} in which each vertex is adjacent to any other vertex of the graph. A clique that has $n$ vertices is denoted as $K_n$.
    \end{frameddefn}

        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{The clique $K_6$.}
        % \label{}
    \end{figure}

    It is easy to see that no clique $K_n$ can be bipartitioned, since there is an edge between any pair of vertices of the graph. However, this is not the only type of graph that cannot be bipartitioned.

    \begin{framedlem}{}
        If $G$ is a bipartite graph, and $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, then $H$ must be bipartite.
    \end{framedlem}
    
    \begin{proof}
        Given a bipartite graph $G = (V, E)$, assume that $(X, V - X)$ is a bipartition of $G$, and let $H$ be a subgraph of $G$; then, it is easy to see that $(X \cap V(H), V(H) - X)$ is a bipartition for $H$.
    \end{proof}

    Note that this lemma implies that $G$ is bipartite if and only if every connected component of $G$ is bipartite: in fact, the direct implication follows from this lemma, and the following figure provides an intuition for the converse implication.

    \begin{framedthm}{Bipartite graphs}
        $G$ is bipartite if and only if $G$ has no odd-length cycle.
    \end{framedthm}

    \proofiff{
        We will prove the contrapositive, i.e. if $G$ has an odd-length cycle, then $G$ cannot be bipartitioned. Consider a graph $G$ with an odd-length cycle $C_{2k + 1}$ of vertices $x_1, \ldots, x_{2k + 1}$; by way of contradiction, assume that $G$ is bipartite through a bipartition $(X, V(G)) - X)$ for some $X \subseteq V(G)$. W.l.o.g. assume that $x_1 \in X$; then, since $X$ defines a bipartition of $G$ it must be that $x_2 \notin X$, and $x_3 \in X$ and so on and so forth. In particular, for any odd value of $i$ we will have that $x_i \in X$, but this implies that both $x_1$ and $x_{2k + 1}$ must be inside $X$, which means that the edge $x_1x_{2k + 1}$ violates the bipartition induced by $X$ $\lightning$.
    }{
        Again, we will prove the contrapositive, i.e. if $G$ is not bipartite it must contain an odd-length cycle. By the previous observation, $G$ is not bipartite if and only if at least one connected component of $G$ is not bipartite, and let this component be $\overline G$. Note that, since $\overline G$ is connected, it must contain a spannning tree $T$ by \cref{spanning tree existence}. Moreover, as previously described, we can always define a bipartition on a tree, namely $(X, V(T) - X)$ where $$X := \{v \in V(T) \mid \dist_T(r, v) \ \mathrm{even}\}$$ for some root node $r \in V(T)$.

        Now, since $T$ is a spanning tree of $\overline G$, which is now bipartite by hypothesis, there must exist an edge $xy \in V(\overline G)$ such that either $x, y \in X$ or $x, y \in V(T) - X$, i.e. the edge $xy$ must have both endpoints in the same set of $T$'s bipartition. Let $z$ be the LCA between $x$ and $y$ in $T$, and $P_x$ and $P_y$ be the paths of the form $x \to r$ and $y \to r$, respectively. Note that, since $xy$ has both endpoints in the same set, it must be that the lengths of $P_x$ and $P_y$ have the same parity by definition of $X$. Lastly, by statement 2 of \cref{tree alt} we have that $r \ P_x \ z = r \ P_y \ z$, which implies that the lengths of $z \ P_x \ x$ and $z \ P_y \ y$ must have the same parity. This concludes that $$z \ P_x \ x \cup z \ P_y \ y \cup xy$$ is an odd-length cycle of $G$.
    }

    At the start of this chapter, we introduced the \tit{Seven Bridges of Königsberg} problem, which led to the emergence of graph theory as a branch of combinatorics. Over time, as the field developed, this problem was formalized into the following definition.

    \begin{frameddefn}{Eulerian tour}
        An \tbf{Eulerian tour} over a graph $G$ is a closed walk that traverses every edge of $G$ exactly once.
    \end{frameddefn}

    For instance, consider the following graph

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering

        \end{tikzpicture}
        % \caption{A simple graph.}
        % \label{first graph}
    \end{figure}

    After some trial an error, it is easy to find an Eulerian tour over this graph, for instance $$1 \ \{1, 2\} \ 2 \ \{2, 5\} \ 5 \ \{5, 3\} \ 3 \ \{3, 4\} \ 4 \ \{4, 5\} \ 5 \ \{5, 1\} \ 1$$ Note that this is a valid Eulerian tour because there is no edge repetition, and vertex repetition is allowed by definition. On the counter side, the graph --- or, more precisely, the \tit{multigraph} --- that the bridges of Königsberg define, which is the following

    does not admit any Eulerian tour. But, given a graph, how can we determine with certainty whether it contains an Eulerian tour? The following theorem, proved by Euler himself in his original paper \cite{konigsberg}, answers this question. Note that this theorem holds both for graphs and multigraph.

    \begin{framedthm}{Eulerian tours}
        A graph $G$ admits an Eulerian tour if and only $G$ is connected and every vertex of $G$ has even degree.
    \end{framedthm}
    
    \proofiff{
        Consider the contrapositive of the direct implication, and assume that $G$ contains at least one odd-degree vertex $v$. Recall that an Eulerian tour is a closed walk that does not allow edge repetition, which implies that the \tit{starting} point of the walk is actually not relevant. Therefore, we can assume w.l.o.g. that any possible Eulerian tour defined on $G$ starts on $v$ itself, but then to be \tit{closed} it must end on $v$ as well. Moreover, each time any Eulerian tour passes through $v$ it must use 2 distinct edges, however $v$ is an odd-degree vertex, therefore at the end of the Eulerian tour there is no way we can come back to $v$ and close the walk.
    }{
        Consider a graph $G$ in which every vertex has even degree, and let $W$ be the \tit{longest} walk of $G$ that does not repeat edges, and let it be labeled as follows $$x_0 \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ x_k$$ 

        \claim{
            $x_0 = x_k$, i.e. $W$ is closed.
        }{
            By way of contradiction, assume that $W$ $x_0 \neq x_k$. If this is the case, then $x_k = v$ for some vertex $v$ that is not $x_0$. Note that $W$ is a \tit{walk}, therefore $v$ may be repeated multiple times inside $W$, i.e. $$x_0 \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ v \ \ldots \ v \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ v$$ If $l$ is the number of times $v$ occurs in $W$ \tit{without counting} $x_k$, then clearly in $W$ there are $2l + 1$ edges incident to $v$, namely $e_k$ and 2 edges each other time $v$ appears in $W$. However, since $2l + 1$ is odd and we assumed that $G$ has no odd-degree vertices, there must exist at least one edge $vu \in E(G)$ such that $u \notin V(W)$. This implies that $$x_0 \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ v \ vu \ u$$ is a longer walk than $W$, and it does not repeat any edges because $uv \notin E(W)$, contradictiong the definition of $W$ $\lightning$.
        }

        This claim proves that $W$ is closed, but we still need to prove that it traverses every edge to claim that it is indeed an Eulerian tour. By way of contradiction, assume that there exists at least one edge $e \notin E(W)$ not used by $W$. Consider an vertex $x_i$ of $W$; by connectivity of $G$, there must exist a path $P$ beween $x_i$ and each of the endpoints of $e$. Let $x_i u$ be the first edge of $P$, for some $u \notin E(W)$. This implies that $$u \ ux_i \ x_i \ e_{i + 1} \ x_{ i+ 1} \ \ \ldots \ x_{k - 1} \ e_k \ x_k \ e_1 \ x_1 \ \ldots \ x_{i - 1} \ e_i \ x_i$$ is a longer walk than $W$ that does not repeat any edge, since $ux_i \notin E(W)$, again contradicting the definition of $W$ $\lightning$.
    }

    Note that this theorem proves that it is not possible to describe an Eulerian tour over the bridges and landmasses of Königsberg, because every vertex of the multigraph has odd degree.

    \section{Exercises}

    \begin{framedprob}{}
        Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph of $n$ vertices, where $n \ge 2$. Show that there must exists two vertices $x, y \in V$ such that $\deg(x) = \deg(y)$.
    \end{framedprob}

    \solution{
        By definition, the range of the possible degrees for any node of $G$ is $[0, n - 1]$. By way of contradiction, assume that for any two vertices $x, y \in V$ it holds that $\deg(x) \neq \deg(y)$; hence, since the graph has $n$ nodes, it must be that each node is assigned a different degree, and that we use all the possible degrees in $[0, n - 1]$. In particular, this implies that there are two vertices $u, v \in V$ such that $\deg(u) = 0$ and $\deg(v) = n - 1$, but this is a contradiction because if the degree of $v$ is $n - 1$, it must be adjacent to all the other nodes of $V$, including $u$, and $\deg(u) = 0$ $\lightning$.
